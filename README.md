This is my AI Project.

## Data

This section explains the data. What is the data structure? What is the dimensions? What is the rows/columns? 

Motivation: you want to land on why this data is interesting? For example, image data can be interesting because we can see if we can create a computer program to recognize images. 

For examples (consider the following image classification tasks):
- digits recognition => interesting, why? => you said: we can train AI to recognize numbers in images => because it can be deployed in traffic cameras and we can check traffic incidence by tracking vehicles' license plate (exactly what I want you to think about); you want to land on industry practice
- rock, paper, scissors => is this interesting => what is the technology? we want to train AI to recognize hand gestures so that we can play rock, paper, scissors with a robot => is there industry practice??? 
- pictures or videos of the American Sign Language => what is the technology? we want to train AI to recognize hand gestures so that the blind people can communicate => how? we can train AI to predict labels of hand gestures and then translate the labels into touchable paper codings so that the blind people can communicate by feeling the symbols without reading them

## Benchmark

This is some benchmark model that is experimented by previous scholar. Some may also refer this section as literature review. 

For example, I am interested in image data. There is a previous scholar worked on this particular image data. They used model ABC and the performance is 80%. 

## Proposed Model/Algorithm

Examples of Proposed Model or Algorithm can be the following:
- Model: mathematical (there is derivation, more of a math paper)
- Algorithm: list of rules (that we can apply a data set, more of a computer science paper)

## Application

This section explains the procedure of adopting the proposed method onto your data set. We show by empirical results the proposed method is better. 

Remark: what do you mean by better? => This is referring to risk/loss functions (the difference between reality and the educated guess from your AI).

Based on your risk functions, you can present the performance of your proposed model/algorithm versus benchmark.
