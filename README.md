# AI-Research on Alzheimer's Disease

![](https://github.com/MysteriousHo-Oh123/AI-Research-/blob/main/pics/tesla-wallpaper.jpg)

This is a research project on creating a high-accuracy, image classification algorithm for Alzheimer's Disease. 

## Data

This project makes use of MRI data compiled and generated by the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) project that can be found on both their [website](https://www.oasis-brains.org/) and this [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/mri-and-alzheimers). This data can be used to train models to detect mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease in patients. 

The [longitudnal MRI data](http://www.oasis-brains.org/pdf/oasis_longitudinal.csv):

<li>
  <ul>Consists of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96</ul>
  <ul>All subjects were right-handed</ul>
  <ul>Each subject was scanned at least once</ul>
  <ul>72 subjects were grouped as "Nondemented"</ul>
  <ul>64 subjects were grouped as "Demented"
    <ul>51 of the 64 "Demented" subjects had mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease</ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>14 subjects were characterized as "Nondemented" in their initial visits and were classified as "Demented" later on. These subjects were grouped as "Converted"</ul>
</li>
  
  
  

## Benchmark

This is some benchmark model that is experimented by previous scholar. Some may also refer this section as literature review. 

For example, I am interested in image data. There is a previous scholar worked on this particular image data. They used model ABC and the performance is 80%. 

## Proposed Model/Algorithm

Examples of Proposed Model or Algorithm can be the following:
- Model: mathematical (there is derivation, more of a math paper)
- Algorithm: list of rules (that we can apply a data set, more of a computer science paper)

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 

## Application

This section explains the procedure of adopting the proposed method onto your data set. We show by empirical results the proposed method is better. 

Remark: what do you mean by better? => This is referring to risk/loss functions (the difference between reality and the educated guess from your AI).

Based on your risk functions, you can present the performance of your proposed model/algorithm versus benchmark.
