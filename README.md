This is a research project on creating a high-accuracy, image classification algorithm for Alzheimer's Disease. 

## Data

This project makes use of MRI data compiled and generated by the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) project that can be found on both their [website](https://www.oasis-brains.org/) and this [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/mri-and-alzheimers). This data can be used to train models to detect mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease in patients. This project shall make use of OASIS 2 (longitudinal MRI data).

The [longitudinal MRI data](http://www.oasis-brains.org/pdf/oasis_longitudinal.csv):

* Consists of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96
* All subjects were right-handed
* Each subject was scanned at least once
* 72 subjects were grouped as "Nondemented"
* 64 subjects were grouped as "Demented"
  * 51 of the 64 "Demented" subjects had mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease
* 14 subjects were characterized as "Nondemented" in their initial visits and were classified as "Demented" later on. These subjects were grouped as "Converted"

## Benchmark

This is some benchmark model that is experimented by previous scholar. Some may also refer this section as literature review. 

For example, I am interested in image data. There is a previous scholar worked on this particular image data. They used model ABC and the performance is 80%. 

## Proposed Model/Algorithm

This project uses classifier models like Random Decision  Forest. 

## Application

This section explains the procedure of adopting the proposed method onto your data set. We show by empirical results the proposed method is better. 

Remark: what do you mean by better? => This is referring to risk/loss functions (the difference between reality and the educated guess from your AI).

Based on your risk functions, you can present the performance of your proposed model/algorithm versus benchmark.
